**Chapter Three — The Great Juluo**

After standing silently in the courtyard and watching Chen Baowan’s carriage fade into the distance, Lin Yi stepped out at his own unhurried pace. As usual, he headed toward the cluster of old bookshops in the southern district of the city.

He wasn’t unaware of the *Linghuang*—the spiritual desolation sweeping the land. The signs had been there for some time, and they had already stirred his doubts.

Even before Chen Baowan had given him a definite answer, Lin Yi had begun to consider his next move.

He had combed through countless ancient texts. History recorded that during previous eras of *Linghuang*—times when spiritual energy all but vanished—the number of newly awakened cultivators plummeted sharply, barely a tenth of what it had been in normal times. Even established practitioners lived shorter lives compared to their peers from calmer ages. Combined with the chaos of wars and shifting powers, within two or three decades after the onset of a *Linghuang*, the entire population of cultivators was reduced by over two-thirds.

The gap between the powerful and the weak among cultivators widened dramatically during these bleak times.

Those who were strong before the *Linghuang* could still grasp scarce resources and grow stronger, while newcomers like Lin Yi, barely able to gather enough *spiritual sprouts* (huangya, 黄芽)—the initial condensed seed of spiritual energy—found their progress agonizingly slow. The gulf in strength became a chasm.

The middle-aged female carriage driver ferrying Chen Baowan sighed inwardly with pity. For someone like Lin Yi to awaken as a cultivator at the dawn of such a desolate age and even form *huangya* was no small feat. Yet she knew well that beyond this point, for cultivators struggling to secure resources, the climb ahead would be a grueling battle against impossible odds.

Lin Yi understood this too. But he wasn’t the type to surrender to fate or wallow in self-pity—and that was why Chen Baowan had spoken so highly of him.

In his mind, even the most barren wasteland held life. If cultivation was possible in this spiritual drought, perhaps the ancients had left behind fragments of wisdom, tucked away in old tomes—knowledge he might yet uncover.

“Lin Yi, you’ve come.”

He was a frequent visitor at the southern city’s old bookshops—places that bought, sold, and rented dusty volumes. Often, he helped patch torn pages or repair bindings for a little coin, earning warm greetings from the shopkeepers.

“Lin Yi, just in time! We received a large shipment of ancient books yesterday, some from the Northern Barbarians,” said one shop owner, his white-streaked hair marking his age. He was an exiled scholar who had fled famine years ago and scraped together this modest bookstall. Seeing Lin Yi flushed from walking so far, he kindly brought over a pot of hot tea.

“Thank you, Uncle Xue,” Lin Yi said with genuine gratitude.

Xue Bo was no wealthy man, but he loved books sincerely. He never charged Lin Yi a single coin for the hours spent poring over his shelves, and Lin Yi often returned the favor with odd jobs.

This time, the batch of books was immense—piled high enough to fill half the small room.

Lin Yi drank the tea, wiped sweat from his brow, and settled cross-legged among the stacks, soon losing himself in their yellowed pages.

Xue Bo left him to it, barring entry to others, granting Lin Yi a rare moment of quiet study.

People in Jiankang traditionally called the northern Wei folk “Northern Barbarians.” The more scholarly among them regarded the Wei with disdain—rough manners, scant regard for ceremony, and a preference for martial prowess over scholarly pursuits.

Such contempt was reflected in their treatment of books.

The tomes from the north bore this out. Many were incomplete, stained with grime, and clearly had been used not for study but as kindling or padding—leftovers preserved by accident rather than reverence.

Yet the content differed sharply from the Jiankang texts. Many recorded customs, histories, and cultivation techniques unique to the northern borderlands.

Lin Yi’s interest peaked quickly.

Two volumes mentioned a cultivator named *Da Juluo* (大俱罗). In the old northern tongue, the name meant one who possessed both divine power and saintly wisdom—a figure who had stood as a paragon during the last *Linghuang*, invincible in the northern realm.

What fascinated Lin Yi most was that Da Juluo had humble origins. According to both texts, he was a mere border town horse trader with no special patronage from royalty or generals—no extraordinary opportunities. He had relied solely on his own cultivation and perseverance to ascend, eventually becoming the strongest cultivator in the northern territories.

“Could this be a clue to a new method of cultivation?” Lin Yi murmured, furrowing his brow.

The authors hinted at this possibility but never confirmed it outright. The texts were vague, veiled in caution.

Turning to an older northern tome, Lin Yi found more on Da Juluo—but it was sparse, offering only that the man had endured countless battles and suffered agonies beyond normal endurance. Details remained elusive.

“Only a visit to the Qitian Academy’s library can give me a better chance,” he thought.

He gathered all books related to the *Linghuang* and set aside the rest, but found no additional leads. The growing intensity of sunlight through the window reminded him that noon approached—and the alumni gathering would soon begin.

“Thanks, Uncle Xue,” Lin Yi said, rising.

He didn’t linger, heading briskly toward the Three-Eyed Bridge.

After only a few hundred steps, a carriage suddenly pulled alongside him with a sharp “whoosh.”

“Lin Yi.”

He halted.

The carriage carried three passengers—two men and a woman—all former classmates.

The woman, calling out to him, was Xiao Suxin. The Xiao clan bore the imperial surname, yet her branch was an old royal line rivaling the current Liang Emperor’s family. Though the emperor had not launched a purge, her position over the last six years had become precarious.

Xiao Suxin’s family background had once been close to Lin Yi’s, their fathers often acquainted. Outside the academy, they’d been frequent companions. Back then, she had been spirited and headstrong—a typical young girl full of romantic dreams. But now, Lin Yi noted, she looked mature and worn, fine lines creasing her eyes—far removed from the coquettish girl he once knew.

Lin Yi smiled and greeted the trio warmly.

The tall, lean man beside Xiao Suxin was Liu Jieshi, once merely the son of a wealthy merchant. After the Liang Emperor’s rise, he had reportedly secured a post overseeing salt logistics, gaining considerable status.

The other, with thick, dark brows and an average build, was Ye Chengyu—the son of the Minister of the Interior, unchanged in bearing.

“Lin Yi, working up a sweat before the reunion? Still think cultivation needs exercise?” Liu Jieshi returned the greeting lightly, while Ye Chengyu sneered with derision.

Many of their classmates had once vied to curry favor with Lin Yi; now time had reversed their attitudes.

Lin Yi, however, took no offense, matching their jibes with good-natured sarcasm.

“I just don’t have a carriage and must walk. Your little ride’s so cramped with three aboard, it’s a wonder you all fit. Maybe next time, you could give me a lift,” he teased, a thinly veiled barb aimed at Ye Chengyu’s modest carriage.

His demeanor was easygoing but firm—never one to kowtow, even before those of great rank.

Xiao Suxin, mindful of old ties, opened her mouth to smooth things over. Yet Liu Jieshi and Ye Chengyu’s faces hardened.

“My carriage is cramped, true enough. We’ll take our leave,” Ye Chengyu said coolly, signaling the driver.

As the carriage pulled away, Lin Yi faintly caught Liu Jieshi’s voice trailing after them: “Still playing the proud, defiant type at this point? That’s a path to ruin…”

Lin Yi felt no ire. He had long grown used to such attitudes over the years—and besides, none of it affected him deeply.

To lose his temper over people like this would only spoil his daily peace.

He was usually punctual, but knowing these classmates wouldn’t arrive early, and only wanting to meet one or two special faces, he slowed his pace, content to let the carriage disappear ahead, dust swirling behind it.
