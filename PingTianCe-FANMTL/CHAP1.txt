### Chapter One: Old Faces in a New Dynasty

As dawn crept over the horizon, an ancient and extraordinary tree began to bloom.

Towering and venerable, the gnarled trunk stood bare of leaves—yet every branch was heavy with countless flower buds, shimmering like pieces of jade.

Beneath the pale morning light, strange insects of iridescent hues and dazzling brocade birds, invisible in the day’s glare, flitted and danced above the canopy.

The buds burst open swiftly, releasing pollen like silver dust, drifting silently on the breeze.

The entire tree bathed in a mysterious radiance; even the scars left by insect rot and past lightning strikes seemed to pulse with newfound life.

But in the blink of an eye, all brilliance faded. The silvery pollen turned a muddy yellow, jade-like petals withered and blackened, then fell like snowflakes of ash, scattered by the wind across the city.

From this ancient tree at the city’s heart, waves of startled cries and lamentations spread like a rising tide, flowing into every corner of the city.

In a dilapidated courtyard to the north of the city, Lin Yi watched from afar as the radiant tree dimmed to lifelessness.

A withered black petal floated on the wind, brushing softly against his cheek. At that moment, the first ray of dawn broke through the sky and illuminated the entire city.

Lin Yi let out a soft sigh and shook his head. Then, turning to the old well within the yard, he began to draw water to wash up.

This was Jiankang City in the spring of the sixth year of the Tianjian era.

Since Emperor Liang Wu ascended the throne and proclaimed the Tianjian reign, making Jiankang the new capital, only six years had passed—but already the city gleamed with unprecedented splendor, a beacon of a new age.

Though the city was new, most of its people were the old guard. Yet with the shifting of imperial power, their fates had diverged sharply in just a few short years.

Today, Lin Yi was to attend a reunion of former classmates.

He had been a student at Qiyun Academy during the previous dynasty.

Qiyun Academy was the finest institution of its time, reserved only for the sons and daughters of nobles and great families.

His father, Lin Wangbei, had held the prestigious post of General of the Chariots and Cavalry—wielding command over powerful armies and influence in court.

But no one could have foreseen the sudden coup that changed everything. Governor Xiao Yan of Yongzhou seized the throne, proclaiming the Liang Dynasty and crowning himself Emperor Liang Wu.

Those who had supported the new emperor swiftly rose to prominence; those who resisted were condemned.

Lin Wangbei had not openly opposed the new regime. Commanding the border forces, he was effectively neutral, but since he had never been close to Emperor Liang Wu, his military power was stripped away, and he was exiled to a remote border county to tend horses. His family’s estates were confiscated.

Lin Yi, once the proud son of a powerful lord, now lived as close to destitution as an orphan.

Among the classmates from those academy days, many shared his fate—some worse, some better. Some had been enslaved, some had seen their entire families executed. Others had vaulted to unimaginable heights, even becoming relatives of the new imperial family.

Reunions were breeding grounds for alliances and rivalries, stages where the fortunate flaunted their status and the fallen were mocked or forgotten.

Lin Yi risked attending, in part because some dear friends had returned, and some he longed to see might come.

The reunion was set for noon, at Qingliu Lane near the Sanyan Bridge in the city’s heart.

He had planned carefully: first to visit some old bookstores in the southern district, then head north to the meeting place—arriving just in time.

Just as he finished washing and grabbed a coarse bun left over from last night for breakfast, he stepped outside—only to hear a clear, sweet voice call his name.

“Lin Yi.”

He turned in surprise.

By the roadside stood an unassuming carriage, without a driver.

The curtain was pulled back, revealing a face both beautiful and refined.

“Chen Baobao?” Lin Yi’s voice held a hint of joy.

She was one of the few classmates he truly wished to see.

Her full name was Chen Baowan, but her family always called her Baobao, and among their circle of friends, the nickname had stuck as a term of endearment.

It had been more than three years since they last met.

Lin Yi blinked, seeing how much she had matured—taller now, nearly as tall as him.

She wore a simple plain cloth garment, but in the rosy dawn light, her graceful silhouette was undeniable.

“You’ve grown even more beautiful after all these years,” Lin Yi said with a genuine smile.

“You’re still as shameless as ever,” Chen Baowan teased, her youthful face alive with laughter. “Not afraid I’ll think you’re too reckless?”

“What brings you here so early?” Lin Yi’s heart warmed seeing her smile, unchanged in so many years.

“I was sent away to study for a time. Only just returned to Jiankang yesterday, and heard you were back. Came early to find you—how’s that for dedication?”

“Missing me that much?” Lin Yi teased, feeling lighthearted.

Chen Baowan laughed like chimes, her eyes gleaming as she looked at the courtyard behind him.

“Since I’m at your doorstep, how about letting me in for a visit?”

“If you don’t mind the place,” Lin Yi invited with a wave. “I’d be honored.”

Chen Baowan followed him inside, her gaze roving with amused curiosity.

She couldn’t help but laugh softly when she noticed the two holes in the roofs of two of the three rooms.

“Those are just filled with useless junk,” Lin Yi replied lightly. “I live alone, so only use one room. But if you ever want to stay over, I could patch one up for you.”

“You’re bold. Not afraid the wrong ears will catch wind?” Chen Baowan scoffed. “I guess this reunion means you want to see her, huh?”

Lin Yi did not deny it.

“I do. But I doubt it’ll happen. Still, you’re one of the four reasons I’m going.”

“Four? Who else besides her and Shitou?” Chen Baowan’s smile faded, turning serious.

“There’s also Lin Yuxuan,” Lin Yi answered quietly. “Technically a distant cousin of mine.”

Chen Baowan appraised him, curious. “You and her close? I never noticed that at the academy.”

Lin Yi explained, “I worry about her situation. Because of my family’s fall, she’s been affected too. She was always quiet at school, never causing trouble—an easy target for bullies.”

Chen Baowan shook her head in amusement. “Lin Yi, I didn’t know you were such a protector.”

Lin Yi smiled awkwardly. “Maybe a little. But it’s not just that. She’s truly good. Help her, and she’ll repay you with her whole heart—and you won’t even realize it.”

Chen Baowan was silent for a moment. “People do change.”

“Then let’s hope for the best. You haven’t changed—you’re still the same as ever.” Lin Yi’s laugh was light, but sincere.

Chen Baowan did not smile.

“You’re still the same,” she said, gazing into his eyes. “Optimistic and confident, but just as innocent. Maybe my worries were for nothing.”

She reached into her sleeve and pulled out a small, gray wooden box, handing it to him.

Lin Yi blinked in surprise. “What’s this?”

“Inside is a Huangya Dan—a Yellow Sprout Pill—and a recommendation letter. With these, you can enter Nantian Academy directly.” Chen Baowan spoke plainly.

Lin Yi was stunned. He shook his head. “This is too precious. I know such things are no small matter, even for you. I can’t accept it.”

Chen Baowan folded her hands behind her back, unmoved by his refusal. “This gift was always meant for you. Though others see me as the daughter of the Minister of State now, to you I’m still Baobao. And I’m sure that if fortune reversed—if my family fell from power—you’d still stand by me.”

Lin Yi frowned and pondered a moment. “I do need the recommendation. But the Huangya Dan—I don’t.”

“I can see you’ve already condensed your Huangya.” Chen Baowan smiled. Then her expression darkened as she turned toward the ancient tree’s direction. “But these times are unlike before. Now that you have formed your Huangya—become a true cultivator—you should realize that the Age of Linghuang—the Spirit Wilderness—has truly begun.”

“Is it really certain?” Lin Yi’s heart skipped. His face paled.

“The situation is worse than you imagine.” Chen Baowan hesitated, then lowered her voice so only they could hear: “This is a secret even the court dare not reveal. The world’s spiritual energy is thinning year by year. This year, the flow of heavenly qi will not only fail to sustain the Jade Bloom Tree—it will wither and die soon. Spirit herbs for cultivation will become rarer than ever. Though you no longer need the Huangya Dan to form your Huangya, it still refines and strengthens your cultivation. More importantly, the depletion of spiritual energy moves from south to north—our southern lands will lose it faster than the north.”

Her words were barely a whisper, yet to Lin Yi’s ears, they crashed like thunder—more terrifying than anything said before.
