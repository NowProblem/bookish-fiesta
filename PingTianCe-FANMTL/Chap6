## Chapter 6: A Narrow Heart

“Old classmates reunited—surely there should be only joy in our hearts,” Shi Chong said diplomatically, smoothing his temper into a polite smile as he joined the drinking and small talk.

Just then, a tall, arrogant young man approached Lin Yi, wine goblet in hand, eyes glinting with teasing malice.

“Lin Yi, long time no see. What have you been doing these days?” he purred.

Lin Yi frowned. This was Zhao Ronghe—his name meant “broad‑minded,” hoping he could “hold broad valleys,” but in truth Zhao’s heart was narrower than any. At Qitian Academy, he once preyed on weaker students—until Lin Yi confronted him.

Sensing the barb, Lin Yi remained calm. “I’ve just been copying sutras at a few Buddhist temples around the city to earn what I need. It pays the bills, and that’s about it.”

Zhao Ronghe drained his cup in one gulp. “You were the most outstanding among us—who would’ve thought that the top student would end up copying scriptures in temples?”

Everyone knew Zhao was insulting Lin Yi. Even Fei Yu, usually quick-witted, felt uneasy and quickly interjected: “Come on! Let’s drink! Let’s not spoil the mood!”

But Shi Chong bristled at the mockery of his friend. “So you were the star student back then, and now you’re nothing?” he sneered. “So what if he copies sutras to support himself? Don’t tell me you think you're superior, Zhao Ronghe?”

Zhao’s eyes sharpened. “And you, Shi Chong—are you saying that just because you lost to Lin Yi back then, you’re still not a match for him now?”

Shi Chong laughed. “Absolutely. With your temperament? There’s no way you surpass Lin Yi.”

Zhao’s face twisted in anger, glass in hand, and with a snap he crushed the goblet.

“Want a rematch?” he hissed.

“Really—this is a reunion, not a duel,” others protested. “We haven’t even eaten yet—don’t turn this into the academy’s sparring field!”

“Zhao Ronghe, let bygones be bygones. That was childish fighting.”

“Lin Yi, you were the one who struck first back then—just offer an apology and a drink.”

A few classmates even warned Lin Yi: Zhao had since been a military drill instructor—strong and hardened. If they fought, Lin Yi might regret it.

Lin Yi shook his head and whispered to Shi Chong, “Forget it. Don’t stir trouble.” He’d already been weighed down by grief over learning about Lin Yuxuan. His real desire was to slip away quietly with Shi Chong.

With a polite nod to Fei Yu and the others, he moved to leave. But Zhao Ronghe softened his tone.

“Well, if you won’t apologize—aren’t you at least giving me a cup to smooth things over?” he let slip a smirk.

Lin Yi’s lips twitched. “No apology needed. You defamed two new students, struck one without cause—and I stepped in. If you had the skill to beat me, perhaps things would’ve ended differently.”

His tone was calm—icy calm—but every word echoed across the courtyard. Eyes fell on him, sharp with silence.

One former ally of Zhao glanced awkwardly. “Lin Yi, that’s… unfair.”

Lin Yi turned to face him. “Did I speak wrongly?”

That man, Qiu Huifeng—once sycophantic and eager to align with power—stammered and subtly backed away, unsettled by Lin Yi’s composure.

“I’ve had enough,” a female voice rang out. It was Xiao Suxin—herself no stranger to disappointment. “Today’s gathering should strengthen friendship, not rehash old grudges!”

Shi Chong and Lin Yi exchanged surprised glances.

Seeing Zhao lose face, Shi Chong laughed bitterly: “You’re so full of yourself—falling from grace yet acting so aloof. If you won’t soften your words, let’s see whether your fists or your mouth is tougher.”

“No one stop this,” Lin Yi said softly to Xiao Suxin, shaking his head. Then, with quiet resolve, he stepped into an open space.

Even Fei Yu could only give a helpless smile. “How did it come to this?”

Shi Chong barked at others to clear the area and shift aside table and chairs, anticipating the clash.

Zhao Ronghe glared at Lin Yi, rage coiling in his chest. “You move first.”

Lin Yi gave no reply—only a look of disdain.

Zhao could contain himself no longer: he lunged, launching a powerful thrust-punch—*biao ci quan*, the “javelin‑pierce punch”—straight at Lin Yi’s chest.

There was no warning. A shocking burst of force in the air. Rocks cracked under Zhao’s strike as he propelled himself forward, muscles bulging like packed boulders beneath his skin.

Shi Chong, watching, roared, “Bet anyone? I wager Zhao Ronghe can’t land three strikes on Lin Yi—I’ll buy a pot of wine!”

Before he finished, Lin Yi’s left forearm shot up, meeting Zhao’s wrist with a thunderous snap.

“How many blows do you need?” Lin Yi asked, voice quiet.

He didn’t budge, but Zhao groaned and dropped—two staggering steps back.

“You…”

Disbelief and fear flashed in Zhao’s eyes as pain lanced through his wrist. His entire arm trembled, powerless.

But Lin Yi closed the distance in an instant, delivering a straight punch mirrored from Zhao’s own technique.

Panic seized Zhao—he knew this strike would break ribs. He ducked to roll aside, seeking escape.

Still, Lin Yi’s momentum shifted. In a swift, descending blow, his fist swung down toward Zhao’s head.

Zhao froze mid-breath, arms crossed overhead in desperate defense.

*Smack.*

The force rattled him—and though he’d managed to block, Lin Yi’s strength still shattered sleeves as they scraped in impact. Zhao’s garments shredded.

He went limp. From feet to knees, his muscles gave out. He collapsed to his knees with a heavy thud.

A hush fell over the gathering—a chorus of labored breaths.

They all stared. Only such a gap in strength would allow one man to remain unaffected, while his opponent collapsed instantly.

They knew this feeling from academy days: the weaker man’s body would ache for days after, back and limbs numb to the bone.

How could this be? Zhao had been a military trainer—the most disciplined of them all. Meanwhile, Lin Yi spent hours working to earn his keep. And yet the disparity was even greater than in their academy days.

Then: *Clack.* A wooden box tumbled out of Lin Yi’s torn sleeve, falling to the ground.

All eyes turned.
