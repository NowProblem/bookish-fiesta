Sure! Here's a toned-down, simpler English translation of the passage you gave, keeping it clear and faithful but easier to read:

**Chapter 2: The North-South Conflict**

Many old books mention the “Linghuang” (spiritual desolation).
In cultivation records, it’s often called the “End of Dharma Spiritual Exhaustion.”

It’s simply a natural phenomenon in the world.

For ordinary people, it’s something they can’t feel, but for cultivators, it affects the flow of spiritual energy — the source of their power.

At certain times, this spiritual energy becomes thinner and harder to find.

Cultivators absorb this energy to transform it into their own strength. When the energy is weak, it becomes harder to reach higher levels, especially for new cultivators trying to catch up with those before them.

It’s not just people; even the rare spiritual herbs that grow by absorbing this energy will grow slower or even die when the energy is scarce.

“There have been three recorded times of Linghuang in the cultivation world. The shortest lasted over 60 years, the longest nearly 200 years,” Chen Baowan said quietly. She had known this for a long time and kept calm: “Judging by all signs, the current Linghuang we are facing won’t be too short or too long, maybe about a hundred years.”

Lin Yi smiled bitterly and said, “Even sixty years is enough to affect our whole lives. The exact length doesn’t matter.”

Chen Baowan nodded.

The important thing is that the Linghuang in the south is happening faster than in the north.

The south is ruled by the Liang kingdom.

During the six years since Emperor Liang Wu came to power, he has been a hardworking and capable ruler. Compared to the previous emperors, he’s much better. The prosperous capital city Jian Kang reflects the strength of the Liang kingdom.

But there’s more than one Liang kingdom in the world.

In the north, there is Wei.

Fifteen years ago, Emperor Wei Xiaowen unified the north and moved the capital to Luoyang. The north watches the south closely. Even with Liang’s prosperity, the two kingdoms are at a stalemate.

Liang Wu’s success in gaining power was not just because the former emperor was weak, but also because the northern Wei kingdom kept pressing south, making officials lose faith in the old emperor’s rule.

“Is a big war coming?” Lin Yi took a deep breath and looked at Chen Baowan.

Chen Baowan looked back at him without speaking.

It was clear.

The north has always been aggressive, usually invading the south. But now, the south has to take the fight northward.

Lin Yi felt sad. His parents served on the border in the army. Because of their high rank, they couldn’t get exemptions, and they hadn’t been able to send letters for years. If a big war broke out, he might never see his parents again.

“It’s not just this city or these people changing, the whole world is changing. I won’t go to the reunion today. I’m not close with the others, and pretending to be friendly is pointless,” Chen Baowan said plainly, just like when they studied together before.

“I advise you not to go either. For one, you might be targeted. Also, I doubt Xiao Shufei will go. What use would old classmates be to her now? She’s smart — if she cared about old feelings, she wouldn’t show up around you. If people think you two still have ties, it could bring trouble.”

Lin Yi smiled bitterly.

Xiao Shufei was the “her” Chen Baowan mentioned earlier — one of the four people Lin Yi most wanted to see.

Back at Qi Yun Academy, Lin Yi and Xiao Shufei were top students, both from good families, and they had a quiet affection for each other. They weren’t engaged, but if things hadn’t changed, they would likely have married.

Now it was different. Xiao Shufei’s last name was Xiao, and Emperor Liang Wu was her father’s brother. Her father was a powerful general and noble, almost like a princess.

Lin Yi came from a family that had fallen from grace. It was no wonder Chen Baowan spoke so frankly — his status was far below Xiao Shufei’s.

“I’m free anyway, I’ll go see,” Lin Yi said.

Chen Baowan knew he meant well but shook her head and didn’t hide it. “My father used to say: ‘If heaven abandons you but you don’t abandon yourself, there’s still hope. If you give up on yourself, then you’re like a pile of mud—there’s no saving you.’”

Chen Baowan smiled instead of getting angry.

Lin Yi was still the same stubborn, confident, and optimistic person. To her, he was genuine — unlike many young talents who were fake.

“Suit yourself. I came back especially to see you.” Chen Baowan brushed her hair out of her face in the morning breeze. “My family has arranged many things. I’ll leave Jian Kang this afternoon.”

“Where will you go?”

“Maybe Sizhou, maybe Shangyong County. Not sure yet,” Chen Baowan said. “But definitely north.”

Lin Yi thought for a moment. “There’s one more thing I want your help with.”

Chen Baowan was casual. “What is it?”

“I want to visit the Qi Yun Academy library again. They have many ancient books on Linghuang that might help. But many old books are banned, and some banned books collected from everywhere are kept there. With my status, I’m not allowed to enter and read them.” Lin Yi spoke casually, not asking for a favor, knowing Chen Baowan would help if she could.

Chen Baowan agreed immediately. “Easy. Just go tomorrow. I’ll arrange someone to meet you. Or you can go after the reunion today.”

“I’ll go after the reunion then.”

“Okay.” Chen Baowan raised an eyebrow. “But don’t forget to report to Nantiang Academy three days later. Don’t get lost in books and forget again.”

“You weren’t any better.” Lin Yi laughed.

They were both bookworms at Qi Yun Academy. At first, they didn’t have much contact. Chen Baowan was straightforward and didn’t hide her opinions, so many classmates found her hard to get along with. But one time, they both forgot time while reading in the same library, staying for two days and nights. When other classmates found them, they realized how long it had been, and that’s when Lin Yi and Chen Baowan became friends.

Later, they got along very well.

“The kingdom changed, the world changed, but luckily you haven’t,” Chen Baowan smiled and slowly turned away. “Take care.”

“The closer to the north, the slower the spiritual energy disappears, but the front line is closer and more dangerous. Be careful,” Lin Yi said. He knew she was leaving and felt unsure what to say, sensing this goodbye might be the last.

“Miss, why did you specially get a recommendation letter and a Yellow Sprout Pill for him?” The middle-aged female coachman waiting by the carriage looked at the rundown courtyard with confusion. “His identity is special and might bring trouble.”

“Special?” Chen Baowan sat down in the carriage. When the curtain closed, a brief sadness crossed her face. “You could say that. He has everything those noble classmates lacked back then. Even after all his hardships, he’s formed his own ‘Yellow Sprout’ without even needing this pill. Isn’t that special?”

The coachman was silent for a moment, then sighed quietly as the carriage started moving, thinking, “What a pity.”

If you'd like, I can keep doing this style for the rest. What do you think?
