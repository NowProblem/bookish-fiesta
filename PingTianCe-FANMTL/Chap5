## Chapter 5: The Cultivator

In every dynasty, cultivators form a rare—yet pivotal—stratum. Though their numbers are few, their power eclipses that of ordinary martial artists. On the battlefield, they often prove decisive.

Across the land’s academies, promising children are selected eagerly and trained with utmost care. Yet even so, only a handful in ten thousand will truly ascend to become a cultivator.

Take Qitian Academy for instance. Lin Yi’s classmates were either wealthy or well-connected, many having taken powerful tonics since childhood. In most cases at least one parent was a cultivator. Even so, despite such advantages, most never succeeded.

To become a cultivator, one must first achieve “qi awareness” (qi‑gan): a clear, conscious perception of the internal flow of qi during meditation, sensing the spiritual energy embedded in the world. Only then can one attempt to forcibly absorb spiritual qi—lingqi—into the body through breath control. With consistent refinement, the qi accumulates to a critical mass, transforming the physical body and granting it abilities far beyond ordinary men. This is true cultivation: the passage known as “condensing the Yellow Shoot” (Huang Ya).

Cultivators at the Yellow‑Shoot stage are still nascent, their True Essence too faint. The lingqi within flows in tendrils—neither green nor gold—twisting in pursuit like newborn sprouts. The metaphor fits: fragile, young, and yet full of potential.

Shi Chong embraced Lin Yi tightly. Then, separating, he lowered his voice in Lin Yi’s ear, eyes blazing: “Do you realize what we’ve stumbled upon? Tong of Heaven (Datian)’s millennium‑rare spiritual famine (Linghuang) has descended—and you condensed your Yellow Shoot so quickly. I’m stunned.”

Lin Yi’s reply was equally hushed: “I suspected something, but only this morning did I confirm. Chen Baowan came to see me and told me about it.”

Shi Chong’s eyes widened, round as copper bells. “She sought you out at dawn? Before I even got there—and told you first?”

He’d rushed back to Jiankang overnight, hoping to break the news himself. He’d even gone to Lin Yi’s modest courtyard early that morning, waited till nearly noon—but never saw him. Hearing Lin Yi’s words, he realized the truth: Chen Baowan had shown up before sunrise, waiting for him. She’d beaten him to it.

“Could it be that she harbors deep feelings for you—long‑secret admiration?” Shi Chong said without a filter.

Lin Yi snorted and glared. “And if she did—so what? Think for yourself. What am I, what is she… we’re no different than with Shu Fei.”

Shi Chong paused, scratching his head, glancing around. “Shu Fei truly didn’t come, did she?”

But his tone turned sober. “I’ve checked the numbers: as at each previous Linghuang, the ambient spiritual energy has thinned—making it far harder for new cultivators to transform. Those who succeed this time are only one‑tenth the number of previous cycles. Exactly the same as before. Very few of our classmates here—none, perhaps—have actually condensed a Yellow Shoot. Lin Yi, don’t be discouraged.”

Lin Yi laughed wryly. “Discouraged? Hardly. I was merely stating the cold facts of my situation. You know better than I do that no one supports me—I’m utterly alone. The gap in status means those backed and trained by powerful patrons rise like full moons on high, utterly unreachable.”

Shi Chong fell silent—he knew the deeper truths he hinted at. Then after a moment, he leaned closer: “Under ordinary circumstances, you might be a hidden treasure. Your talent is nearly unrivaled.” He sighed. “But the current situation is graver than you suspect. Spirit‑herb supplies are wilting; since last year, most alchemical pills are now tightly controlled. In the south, spiritual energy dissipates faster than in the north. We have only two options: either pour pills into already strong cultivators, breeding a few top elites—or seize rare regions where spiritual energy remains abundant. But both paths lead to one inevitable consequence…”

Lin Yi replied solemnly, “War.”

Shi Chong nodded gravely. “War between Northern Wei and our Southern Liang. Negotiation is unlikely—this may become a fight to the death. And once the northern barbarians sense our fatigue, they’ll press on: lose now, and we’re done.”

Lin Yi forced a bitter smile. “We’ve enjoyed six peaceful years so far.”

Shi Chong continued, voice steady: “Here’s something you must know—it involves you directly. His Majesty has reigned only six years. He usurped the throne in a coup—and now, this Linghuang. Many whisper that his rise enraged Heaven itself. Naturally, he fears those high officials from the old regime—especially those he stripped of power. You must watch your step. Previously, at Qitian Academy, his rule was lenient enough that weaklings like you might go unnoticed. But now…political winds may shift. Who knows how harsh his mandates will grow.”

Lin Yi’s gaze darkened. He thought, first of his own future—but most of all, of his parents exiled to the northern frontier, barely surviving.

Shi Chong read his look, placing a reassuring hand on his shoulder. “I’ve asked about them,” he said quietly. “You can rest easy—they’re alive, though struggling. And if war erupts, your father’s situation may improve. The Emperor is no tyrant—he knows war demands capable men. Your father wasn’t a foolishly loyal sycophant of the old dynasty, nor was he corrupt or tied to the old regime. But you…”

He paused with a rueful smile. “That’s why I came: to ask if you’d join the army. Officially you’d be my attendant—but as brothers, I wouldn’t let you suffer.”

Lin Yi waved his hand, feeling both touched and somber. “No need to explain. But there’s another path. Chen Baowan secured a recommendation letter for me to join Nantiān Academy.”

Shi Chong froze, disbelief etched across his face. “Qitian Academy was the old dynasty’s finest. It’s been abolished; now it’s just a library. Nantiān Academy replaced it—moved from Liang to Jiankang, staffed with the best masters. Enrollment there is far more prestigious than even low‑rank officials. For Baowan to secure a recommendation for someone like you—that’s extraordinary. Fewer than five such recommendations are granted each year.”

Lin Yi smiled quietly. “She’s offering help, so how could I refuse? Now, what about Lin Yuxuan?”

Shi Chong’s face fell. “Truth?” he hesitated. Lin Yi urged him on. “Truth.”

“She no longer walks this world,” Shi Chong said slowly. “Her situation…much worse than you’d known. Her family begged the Huang clan of Ningzhou to take her as a concubine—and though she suffered in silence, she contracted a wasting illness and died two years ago.”

Lin Yi felt as though his chest had collapsed. The crushing weight of grief brought tears to his eyes—something inside him shattered.

He remembered her warmth: how she always returned a kindness, sweeping his seat, tracking after him to carry burdens. She never sought praise, yet remembered every small gesture. Such gentle charity, now forever lost.

After a long moment, he finally asked in a low voice, “Which Huang family? Of Ningzhou?”

Shi Chong’s expression flickered. “The one tied to Minister Huang, the Prime Minister.”

Lin Yi responded quietly, deliberately, “I’ll remember that debt.”

His voice flat, cold—though his face remained calm.

Shi Chong broke into a bitter laugh. “Still my steadfast brother, Lin Yi—nothing’s changed.”

Just then, a buoyant voice interrupted: **“Shi Chong, Lin Yi—what are you two whispering about so joyfully?”** High-spirited Fei Yu appeared with classmates carrying wine cups, beaming with warmth as they came to offer a toast.
