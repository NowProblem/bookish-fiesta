**Chapter Four — The Class Reunion**

Just as Lin Yi had expected, by the time he reached the famed old bridge—Three-Eyed Bridge—there were still carriages arriving one after another, stopping in front of the riverside teahouse nestled beneath its stone arch.

Several familiar figures alighted from the carriages, their faces unchanged from his memory.

“Lin Yi!”

A clear, warm voice called out. A refined-looking young man, face glowing with cheerful enthusiasm, waved at him with exaggerated friendliness.

This classmate was Fei Yu. He and Lin Yi had never been especially close, but Fei Yu had always been the sort of man who knew how to charm everyone—always courteous, never offending, sleeves ever flowing with grace. In the imperial court, he had deftly navigated the political tides, now holding the prestigious post of *Situjijiu*—Overseer of Ritual and Education. In fact, among all their old classmates, Fei Yu held the highest rank in the current dynasty. Today’s gathering had been organized by him and two others.

Lin Yi had never much liked that kind of carefully curated pleasantness—it reeked of falseness. But Fei Yu greeted him with such open courtesy that it would be petty to respond coldly. Lin Yi returned the smile.

“Lord Jijiu Fei. It’s been too long.”

At Fei Yu’s arrival, many within the teahouse came out to welcome him. Polite exchanges filled the air, and in an instant, the atmosphere buzzed with laughter and chatter.

Most of the guests also greeted Lin Yi warmly enough, but he could sense the subtle shift in their expressions—the careful distance. After all, he was the son of a disgraced official, his path through officialdom all but severed. No one wanted to linger in conversation with him, lest trouble follow. A few polite words, then they turned away to speak with others, leaving Lin Yi conspicuously alone.

He didn’t mind.

In fact, he welcomed the solitude. He slipped into a quiet corner of the reserved hall—*Qingliu Pavilion*—choosing a seat by the river window and poured himself a cup of tea.

Naturally, others who had fallen from grace or found no place in the crowd gravitated to the edges as well. A handful of classmates joined his table, though they mostly kept silent, spirits dulled by disappointment. One even drank alone in silence, nursing his wine like medicine for a soul long worn thin.

Half an hour passed, and no more guests arrived. Noon had come and gone, and the streets of Jiankang had grown still, even the clatter of hooves fading with the heat of the day.

Leaning against the window sill, chin propped in one hand, Lin Yi gazed down at a drifting leaf carried away by the river’s current. A quiet sigh slipped from his lips.

It wasn’t just Xiao Shufei who hadn’t come. The two others he had hoped to see were absent as well.

By now, the reunion had officially begun. The organizers were raising toasts, and platters of food began arriving in endless succession.

The room swelled with cheerful noise, but Lin Yi barely heard any of it. His thoughts were elsewhere, adrift with memories that rose like mist, only to be swept away again.

He had already decided—there was no need to linger. He’d stay for a few dishes, make a quiet excuse, and slip out unnoticed.

“Lin Yi.”

A soft voice called his name, and he turned.

It was Xiao Suxin once again. She approached with a wine cup in hand and an apologetic look in her eyes.

“I’m sorry about earlier,” she said gently. “It wasn’t my intent to side with Ye Chengyu or the others. I simply happened to arrive at the same time and couldn’t refuse the ride.”

Her voice trembled slightly, and so did her hand. She was clearly not accustomed to strong drink, nor was she entirely composed.

“It’s nothing worth fussing over,” Lin Yi said, raising his cup to her with a smile. He drank in one smooth motion and gestured subtly for her to go easy on the wine.

“To be honest,” Xiao Suxin said after a sip, her voice steadier now, “I hadn’t planned to attend this reunion either. But I was afraid... if I didn’t come today, I might never get the chance to see any of you again.”

She paused, hesitating, then finally spoke in a low, bitter voice: “In a few months, I’ll be married off to Pingxing Commandery.”

“Pingxing?” Lin Yi’s brows rose. He studied her face and saw no trace of joy. “What’s the family like?”

“They’re merchants. Wealthy, but I’ve never met the man,” she said with a faint, bitter smile.

Lin Yi understood well enough.

In another life, with her status, she would never have been sent to marry into some remote borderland family—let alone one with no scholarly lineage, no official rank. And now, she didn’t even know if the man was handsome, talented, or even decent.

“I hope your husband will be the kind of man you deserve,” Lin Yi said sincerely, raising his cup to her again in a gesture of blessing.

Xiao Suxin drained the cup. Her eyes reddened. Whether from the wine or something else, it was hard to say—but something within her seemed to awaken.

“To tell the truth,” she said, her voice more candid now, “you were one of the few people I truly wanted to see today. You may not realize it, but you were always the top of our class—brilliant, kind, and fair. Most of the girls saw you as a brother, someone to rely on. Honestly, if it hadn’t been for the feelings between you and Xiao Shufei, I don’t know how many girls would have secretly fallen for you.”

“Really?” Lin Yi smiled faintly. Hearing Xiao Shufei’s name pricked something inside him, but he kept it hidden behind a mask of quiet humor. “I was that popular?”

“Of course you were,” Xiao Suxin said, nodding fiercely. Her voice grew colder, sharper. “If this were still the old dynasty, even if you sat in the darkest corner refusing to speak, everyone in this room would still be looking to you as their leader.”

Lin Yi chuckled, warmth blooming in his chest. “That might be the kindest thing I’ve heard all day. But the world has changed.”

He thought for a moment, then added gently, “Still, the world turns in strange ways. Who knows what tomorrow brings? Don’t give up on yourself. And don’t forget what we learned at the Academy—our cultivation methods, our spirit.”

“I won’t,” Xiao Suxin said, her voice soft but firm. She hadn’t spoken so freely in a long time, nor had anyone encouraged her like this in years. She met Lin Yi’s eyes and nodded earnestly. “Thank you.”

“Take care of yourself.” Lin Yi toasted her one final time.

Though his tolerance for drink was solid, the lack of food that morning, paired with the strong wine, left his head a little dazed.

He picked at a few dishes to settle his stomach and was just about to slip away—when the sound of thundering hooves shattered the hum of conversation like a downpour slamming into a quiet street.

The entire teahouse fell silent, eyes turning toward the road outside in surprise.

Lin Yi’s heart gave a jolt.

Not a carriage—but two tall, powerful warhorses galloped into view.

One of them had no rider, its saddle empty. The other bore a broad-shouldered, boisterous young man.

Stone!

His real name was Shi Chong, but “Stone” had always suited him better—stubborn, unmovable, and fierce. He and Lin Yi were more than old classmates—they were sworn brothers in all but name. During their Academy days, they had been inseparable, even getting into trouble together more than once for bending or outright breaking school rules.

Though Lin Yi sat at the far corner by the window, Shi Chong spotted him instantly, even from the galloping steed. He reined in the horse with a joyful shout.

“Lin Yi! You rascal! You’re here already? I even went by your place to pick you up—and the damn place was empty!”

Lin Yi’s chest warmed at once. So that was why Shi Chong was late—he had gone looking for him first. That empty-saddled horse had clearly been meant for him.

Shi Chong’s father, Shi Hu, had served as *General Who Pacifies the East* in the former dynasty—a fierce warlord who was no one’s pawn. Though not favored by the current Emperor Liang, he was respected for his unflinching loyalty and military talent. The new regime had retained him, bestowing upon him the title *Right Flank General*, and he remained a man with real power.

After graduating, Shi Chong had followed his father into the military. Lin Yi had lost track of him over the years and had no idea where he’d been stationed.

Others in the room, especially those now in courtly or civil positions, clearly recognized him. As Shi Chong entered, cries of welcome rang out:

“General Shi!”

“You’re late, General—penalty drink!”

Lin Yi didn’t get up to greet him. There was no need for such formalities between brothers.

Shi Chong barely acknowledged the others. With a few curt nods, he made his way through the crowd straight to Lin Yi


’s corner and landed a heavy punch on his chest.

“Lin Yi, you bastard! Have you missed me or not?”

Lin Yi grinned. “You want to get punished again like old times?”

As Shi Chong’s fist landed, a subtle ripple of force pulsed between them—hot and sharp. Both felt it.

Their eyes widened in unison.

“You’ve formed your **Huangya**?” Shi Chong whispered, thrilled beyond measure, pulling him into a bear hug. “Lin Yi, that’s incredible!”
